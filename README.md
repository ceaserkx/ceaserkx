I grew up in Roanoke Rapids, NC, a relatively small city. One thing anyone that knows me will tell you, I'm extremely competitive, 
almost to a fault. As a result I can at times be hard on myself when I don't meet my expectations or goals. Throughout my childhood I always aimed 
for that #1 spot, whether that be in Chess tournaments or in Art class. If I'm not in the top 5%, I'm uncomfortable. So of course
my dream job was to be a US Naval Fighter Pilot. I worked towards this all throughout highschool, but when I finally got to MEPS, I was
ungracefully told "Yeah, you won't be flying anytime soon". My eyesight was not where it needed to be. Fast forward to bootcamp I know
now that I'm going to be an Intelligence Specialist for the Navy. My dad always joked that one day I'd be a real life James Bond. Well,
I don't know about that but I did participate in Top Secret daily operations and annual exercises. I really enjoyed working with my team to hunt for
the baddies. That was a good time. Fast forward again
towards the end of my 6 year contract, I know I'm not reenlisting, but I really enjoy solving problems with technical analysis.
That's when I really clung to cybersecurity. I immediately enrolled into WGU to further my education into the field. (In fact, at the time (Fall 2023)
I was enrolled full-time as an Architectural Engineering student before I switched paths... wow). It was also very convenient that I had been working 
as a Network Repair Analyst for Charter Communications, which involved troubleshooting and alert analysis. Along with school I knew I wanted more out of 
cybersecurity, so I started studying for my Security+ and passed beautifully. I remember being so elated that I scrambled for more information on how to
 be a SOC Analyst. 

The SOC Analyst position intrigued me the most because it reminded me of my work as an Intelligence Specialist; constantly on the hunt for 
threats that put the good guys at an adverse risk. I therefore researched personal projects I could complete that would sharpen my skills as
a SOC Analyst specifically. I practiced configuring SIEMS and EDRs, and penetrating simulated virtual networks I created on VirtualBox. I was
invited to work as a Cybersercurity Systems Analyst where I am charged with managing a handful of big picture security projects from a compliance perspective.
I really enjoy my work, but it's not the SOC life I imagined. So that's where we are now. You will see that my github is focused on proving my skills as
a security professsional in general, with a focus on SOC concepts.
